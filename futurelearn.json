","description":"<p>Programming is everywhere: in dishwashers, cars and even space shuttles. This course will help you to understand how programs work and guide you through creating your own computer program – a mobile game.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re a complete newcomer to programming, or have some basic skills, this course provides a challenging but fun way to start programming in Java. Over seven weeks we will introduce the basic constructs that are used in many programming languages and help you to put this knowledge into practice by changing the game code we have provided. You’ll have the freedom to create a game that’s unique to you, with support from the community and educators if you get stuck. You’ll learn how to create algorithms to solve problems and translate these into code, using the same tools as industry professionals worldwide. We will be using Google’s Android Studio as the platform for programming.</p>\n\n<p>The course will combine video introductions, on-screen examples, downloadable guides, articles and discussions to help you understand the principles behind computer programs and the building blocks that are used to create them. Multiple choice quizzes will help you to check your understanding, while exercises each week will show you how to use your new skills to improve your game.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you’ll have a complete game that can be played on an Android phone or tablet, or even your computer. You can share it with your friends and family, use your new knowledge to improve the game further, or even create new games of your own!</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about this course in Professor Shirley Williams’s blog post on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/shortage-of-programmers/\">shortage of programmers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This course teaches the basics of programming and you don’t need any knowledge of coding to take part. You may find it challenging at times, but we hope it will be fun too. However, the course does require you to be comfortable downloading, unzipping and installing software to your computer. If you think that you may find this difficult, you may like to have someone with a good knowledge of IT on hand to help you — particularly in week 1.</p>\n\n<p>The 4 hours per week is an estimate based on past participants’ experiences, however some previous participants have reported taking much less time, while others take considerable longer to complete some weeks. This will depend on your experience and to some extent how powerful your computer is.</p>\n\n<p>The course will give you an opportunity to write and edit your own programming code using specific software. To run this software effectively, we recommend a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) that has a dual-core processor and a minimum of 2GB of RAM — though this may vary. For information on operating system support see the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Requirements\">Android developers’ site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You will need a computer to complete the practical coding exercises in this course, but if you just want to watch the videos and read the tutorials, you should be able to access these on most web connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets and consoles.</p>\n\n<p>We recommended that you have an Android device (such as a phone or tablet) running at least Android 2.2 on which you can test and run your game. If you don’t have an Android device you can use an emulator on your computer, but this is a much slower and more error-prone process.</p>\n\n<p>This course includes video content and other visual teaching methods. As such, blind and visually impaired students may need a helper.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Tech & Coding"],"educator":"Richard  Mitchell","organisation":{"url":"http://www.reading.ac.uk","name":"University of Reading","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/75/87/75874262-136f-472c-82b1-3bc71d8f9aa1.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8237800/video","runs":[{"uuid":"6f24cc01-d18f-42f8-b679-ed0830db5d32","start_date":"2013-10-28","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"2b3b6da3-6da7-4ae2-84fe-9ddf08f91327","start_date":"2014-02-24","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"ed6a9426-6518-453f-9a13-6e6b1b8779ca","start_date":"2014-10-20","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"cb65a9e4-7d83-49f0-bb4c-9e379e463e2d","start_date":"2015-02-16","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"f6b29062-4025-45eb-9b11-e92ba8b32ebf","start_date":"2015-06-01","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"2f93d0a0-1239-4ba2-9b5f-97593f2e9d1b","start_date":"2015-10-12","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"c8ab326b-731f-43cb-86ea-1f2e3137e91d","start_date":"2016-04-04","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"bd832dbe-eb1d-4318-9c8b-7f587eb04ec3","start_date":"2016-10-31","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"b065f373-f365-4a36-979a-28789598d3d4","start_date":null,"duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"088fe01d-5438-402f-a3b1-7212ac334ca8","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/corpus-linguistics?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/33/9f/regular_339ff074-1f50-4a77-a9d8-822cf939be13.jpg","name":"Corpus Linguistics: Method, Analysis, Interpretation","introduction":"Offers a practical introduction to the methodology of corpus linguistics for researchers in social sciences and humanities","description":"<p>The course aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Equip those taking the course with skills necessary for collecting and analysing large digital collections of text (corpora).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Provide educational support for those who want to use the corpus method.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Demonstrate the use of corpus linguistics in the humanities, especially History.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Give a sense of the incredibly wide uses that corpora have been put to.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Allow those with an interest in language, who have not heard of the corpus approach before, a new way of looking at language.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Demonstrate that corpus approaches to social science can offer valuable insight into social reality by investigating the use and manipulation of language in society.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other than an interest in the study of language, there are no requirements to join this course.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Literature","Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Tony McEnery","organisation":{"url":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk","name":"Lancaster University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/47/74/47742afd-0804-4cb4-8a1e-7b228d84ca91.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1550630/video","runs":[{"uuid":"6c037c14-a837-437e-90b6-9735ec38add6","start_date":"2014-01-27","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"3aa3fe03-b71e-47d6-9c43-d829eba756ef","start_date":"2014-09-29","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"7ae542f8-bb34-4550-b0d4-34118b6ef0d2","start_date":"2015-09-28","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"6f383947-b4f9-4010-b26d-436b8dc78ba5","start_date":"2016-09-26","duration_in_weeks":8}]},{"uuid":"924b1510-c2f9-47a5-802e-7f3bfc8e9fdd","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/dental-photography-in-practice?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ab/4f/regular_ab4fe1b5-2203-48de-85fa-ad0b5275d473.jpg","name":"Improving Your Image: Dental Photography in Practice","introduction":"Learn how to achieve consistent and excellent results in all aspects of dental photography with this free online course.","description":"<p>##</p>\n\n<p>This free course will cover all aspects of the use of digital photography in dental practice: intra-oral, extra-oral, and portraits.

It draws upon the experience of staff from the Mathematics Education Centre at Loughborough University - a centre that has specialised for many years in mathematics teaching and mathematics support for science and engineering students who find the transition to university mathematics particularly challenging.</p>\n\n<p>Through an accessible introduction to graphical and algebraic techniques students will start to think mathematically and develop an informal understanding of vital properties of points, lines and curves before formalising mathematically some of these essential notions. We adopt a user-friendly approach and describe mathematical processes in everyday language. New ideas are developed by example and discovery rather than by formal proof.  Further development will introduce the equation of a line and the significance of its slope and vertical intercept.</p>\n\n<p>The course will close by reinforcing the importance of mathematics to science and engineering.

So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.</p>\n\n<p>This two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals, researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.</p>\n\n<p>Delivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:</p>\n\n<p>1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines</p>\n\n<p>2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.</p>\n\n<p>The learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"success-and-feedback-from-the-course\">Success and feedback from the course</h2>\n\n<p>Since April 2014 over 15,000 learners have registered on this course from across the world.

To get a real sense of how the Bard’s world would have actually looked and felt, renowned Shakespearean academic Professor Jonathan Bate will be exploring the acclaimed collections of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Professor Bate is also the Lead Educator, with Dr Paula Byrne, on the new <em><a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/literature\">Literature and Mental Health: Reading for Wellbeing</a></em> FutureLearn course from Warwick.</p>\n\n<p>Each week, Professor Bate will examine a particular play and a cultural theme alongside a selection of treasures from the Trust’s archives in Stratford-upon-Avon. Weekly learning material will be broken down into six video segments, each examining a variety of artefacts and play extracts. The course will open with an introduction to Shakespeare and his living and working environment, moving onto broader cultural themes and issues examined in his plays and ending with an exploration of his legacy.</p>\n\n<p>This course is the result of an exciting new collaboration between the University of Warwick and the <a href=\"http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/\">Shakespeare Birthplace Trust</a>, the world’s leading charity in promoting the works, life and times of William Shakespeare. The course will provide unprecedented access to the Trust’s fascinating historical collections of museum, library and archive items. You will have the chance to look inside the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust vaults where thousands of artefacts are kept. The course will also take you into some of the key locations associated with Shakespeare which are looked after by the Trust, including the house where he was born and grew up.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great opportunity to engage with a topic that has captivated people for centuries, learn from a world expert in the field and enjoy exclusive access to behind-the-scenes historical material.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 id=\"success-and-feedback-from-the-course\">Success and Feedback from the course</h3>\n<p>Over 55,000 learners from across the world have previously joined Jonathan Bate and the teams from the University of Warwick and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust to explore Shakespeare, his plays, and the world in which he lived. Below are some examples of the impact the course had:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This has been an enlightening and thoroughly enjoyable course. Thanks to everyone involved in bringing it to new learners, and special thanks to Jonathan for bringing alive the course materials - your passion and knowledge of your subject was infectious. I’d like to do it all over again.” Natalie Gillett</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Thank you, thank you, thank you! I loved this course because not only did I learn so much about Shakespeare, but also because I enjoyed learning, reading, investigating and getting to know so much people around the world with the same interest, with so much knowledge and passion about the Bard. I admire each of the people who make this course possible, I thank them to make it possible for people around the globe. It was a wonderful experience. THANK YOU!” Paula Mascheroni</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This has been a marvellous course, I am so sorry that it has to end. I have learned an enormous amount and can look at Shakespeare’s plays with a much more inquiring mind than before. It is not enough just to read theme, you need to research the background too. Thank you Professor Bate and Jennifer for making the course so alive and interesting.” Caroline Graham</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at anyone with an interest in Shakespeare; you might be a high school student or a university student, or a regular play-goer who wishes to learn more about Shakespeare. No prior knowledge of Shakespeare life, theatre and world is assumed: that is what you will learn from the course. The only pre-requisite is a willingness to read and watch the plays.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Literature"],"educator":"Jonathan Bate","organisation":{"url":"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk","name":"The University of Warwick","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/64/20/6420e962-128b-482c-90cb-4eee9881dd0e.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1678642/video","runs":[{"uuid":"670dfcc8-bff0-4d5d-aa80-4c23fee87e6a","start_date":"2014-03-03","duration_in_weeks":10},{"uuid":"bc1806ff-4b76-4500-a27f-91d053c1ed8e","start_date":"2014-09-29","duration_in_weeks":10},{"uuid":"c6d8e40b-0ee0-4595-936e-e12da4440c0a","start_date":"2015-10-05","duration_in_weeks":10},{"uuid":"e42f6249-9e6a-4c0a-8cce-8bcccfc59940","start_date":"2016-04-18","duration_in_weeks":10},{"uuid":"d1c18365-ba4e-4674-acb0-fccb9e21c6d0","start_date":"2017-03-20","duration_in_weeks":10}]},{"uuid":"4035cda7-5fc0-4206-97c1-9145e245fd5f","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/start-writing-fiction?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/51/db/regular_51dbd3e2-84fa-4356-ad38-6b76738b6b03.jpg","name":"Start Writing Fiction","introduction":"This hands-on course helps you to get started with your own fiction writing, focusing on the central skill of creating characters.","description":"<p>##</p>\n\n<p>Start Writing Fiction focuses on a skill which is central to the writing of all stories and novels – creating characters.</p>\n\n<p>You will listen to established writers, such as Louis de Bernières, Patricia Duncker, Alex Garland, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Tim Pears, Michèle Roberts and Monique Roffey, talk about how they started writing.

How do we think and decide? This course, from Professor Nick Chater and Warwick Business School, explores the origins of human rationality and irrationality.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"explore-our-illusion-of-mental-depth\">Explore our illusion of mental depth</h4>\n\n<p>Our everyday conception of how our minds work is profoundly misleading. We are victims of an ‘illusion of mental depth’ - we imagine that our thoughts and behaviours arise from hidden motives and beliefs, and that we can understand ourselves by somehow uncovering these hidden forces, whether through therapy, lab experiments or brain scanning.</p>\n\n<p>This course will suggest that this conception is not entirely correct, that we’re inventing these motives and beliefs at the very moment of decision. Professor Chater’s central proposition will be  that there is no mental depth, that mental depth is an illusion.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"understand-mystifying-aspects-of-human-behaviour\">Understand mystifying aspects of human behaviour</h4>\n\n<p>This course consists of six weeks of material. Each week we’ll start with a paradox, some mystifying aspect of human behaviour, before looking at insights into it, gained over decades of psychological and behavioural research. You’ll have a chance to try out a classic psychological experiment online.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the really exciting things we’ll be looking at are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>why we take risks and why we fear them;</li>\n  <li>how people succeed or fail to work with other people successfully;</li>\n  <li>how our behaviour, governed by a plethora of complicated psychological forces, makes sense at all;</li>\n  <li>the theory that we are creating an improvised character and trying to stay in our role;</li>\n  <li>and finally, how we can make society more coherent and create a better world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"meet-behavioural-science-experts-from-academia-government-and-industry\">Meet behavioural science experts from academia, government and industry</h4>\n\n<p>You’ll learn from Warwick Business School’s leading behavioural science group, as well as a diverse range of people who have thought very deeply in a practical context about the nature of human behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll be talking to Rory Sutherland, ad man and behavioural economics impresario; Tim Harford, the Financial Times undercover columnist; Gus O’Donnell, former head of the Civil Service; and many other senior representatives in high-profile organisations.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"what-previous-learners-say\">What previous learners say</h4>\n\n<p>Over 72,000 learners from across the world have joined previous runs of this course, and below are a few examples of the impact it had on them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Absolutely enjoyed every single minute of the course.

But perhaps the most obvious (and often overlooked) quality required of all sound engineers is the ability to listen.</p>\n\n<p>Sound engineers must constantly evaluate the sound quality of individual sound sources in a mix and evaluate how these sound sources interrelate with one another. The ability to listen critically and make these judgements is a skill that must be learnt through trial and error and repeated practice. This free online course aims to provide you with tools for developing and refining the critical listening skills relevant to contemporary sound engineering and will be of interest to musicians, sound enthusiasts and experienced sound engineers alike.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins by examining the nature of sound and how properties of sound (frequency, amplitude and sound intensity, for example) are expressed. The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined. The remainder of the course focuses on the signal processing techniques commonly used by sound engineers when mixing multitrack recordings - for example, equalisation, compression and reverberation.</p>\n\n<p>On completion of the course you will have a thorough understanding of the workflow involved when mixing a multitrack recording and will have developed the critical listening skills necessary to make informed judgements regarding individual and overall sound quality.</p>\n\n<p>No prior knowledge is assumed, but an interest in music and/or audio would be beneficial.

People are increasingly bombarded by dramatic and at times disturbing headlines. Yet general knowledge of Muslims and their faith can be poor. There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic.</p>\n\n<p>This course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade.  This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities.  Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested</p>\n\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n\n<p><em>Islamic Practice</em> An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam.</p>\n\n<p><em>History of Islam in Britain</em> An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Settlement Patterns</em> The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cultural Diversity</em> Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today.</p>\n\n<p><em>Contemporary Debates</em> An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold.</p>\n\n<p>Given current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The course will also include an exciting opportunity to join us live via web streaming for the IslamUK Centre’s Public Lecture Series each week as a series of leading scholars address key topics in depth.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more, read Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/muslims-in-britain-exploring-diversity-and-challenging-stereotypes/\">Muslims in Britain: exploring diversity and challenging stereotypes</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>The course is open to anyone with an interest in religion, culture and history, whether you are a beginner, experienced learner or returning to study.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/","name":"Cardiff University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/95/11/95118ca8-be03-43d0-b088-54dd1b16c014.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2296530/video","runs":[{"uuid":"0b4c9035-3187-4a9f-ad64-05717bd3dcba","start_date":"2014-03-10","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"41d70f04-b88b-4fca-ac7e-e241d2731ea2","start_date":"2015-02-09","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"930360fd-d77e-49c6-be63-37a12d129626","start_date":"2016-02-22","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"7082983f-6095-43f3-a491-c719f757a343","start_date":"2017-02-20","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"78f027e1-0a44-45ee-b54a-f5ebf3a5b5a2","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeares-hamlet?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e9/95/regular_e9953aa7-9c18-4279-8e84-6db2d24652e2.jpg","name":"Shakespeare's Hamlet: Text, Performance and Culture","introduction":"Experts from the Shakespeare Institute guide an exploration of the most famous play ever staged.","description":"<p>Hamlet is the most famous play ever written and the masterpiece of the most important writer in English, William Shakespeare.

We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write.</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs.</p>\n\n<p>Each week we’ll start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound. You’ll learn how to interact with them to change their behaviour, creating increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-with-professional-artists-and-designers\">Learn with professional artists and designers</h3>\n\n<p>We will also look at how leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them.</p>\n\n<p>The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Can a computer be independently creative?</li>\n  <li>Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program?</li>\n  <li>How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology?</li>\n  <li>Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>(Image © 2010 Jon McCormack)</p>\n\n<p>No prior knowledge of programming is necessary, but having an interest or background in any creative area would be beneficial. It is assumed that you have basic computer skills (including how to download software applications) and basic knowledge of files, directories, images and movies. The course involves programming using the <a href=\"https://www.processing.org\">Processing environment</a>, so you will need access to a computer that you can download and install this software on.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":6,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media","Tech & Coding"],"educator":"Jon McCormack","organisation":{"url":"http://www.monash.edu.au","name":"Monash University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ae/74/ae74ed19-ef88-450c-ba2f-bea610decaa0.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1569932/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f420a6e2-9dd9-4886-9dff-15061f598bde","start_date":"2014-06-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"19b38034-b3ec-4761-a633-147f227d97a5","start_date":"2015-08-03","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"e6162891-dcce-4c7c-bcb6-fed127f3d9a0","start_date":"2016-08-01","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"5f68695c-c093-4222-a179-268530662964","start_date":"2017-05-01","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"be3575ea-d399-40da-8f88-39e043e84794","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-theatre?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/9c/24/regular_9c244de4-47ef-4310-9ca9-4734f5109ade.jpg","name":"Physical Theatre: Meyerhold and Biomechanics","introduction":"Learn how to practice Meyerhold’s biomechanics and study its place in the history of physical theatre.","description":"<p>This short three-week course introduces you to world-renowned Russian director Meyerhold’s technique of biomechanics, inviting you to experience first-hand his revolutionary approach to acting – the biomechanical études. You will learn about the techniques and find out more about the history of physical theatre including Meyerhold’s contribution to its development and how, nearly 100 years later, his work is still influencing us today.</p>\n\n<p>Through a mixture of video, animation, interviews with artists, expert panel discussions with professionals, discussion forums and practical exercises you will explore the range of key players in Russian actor training. Meyerhold’s work will be placed in context as an early collaborator with Stanislavsky and a contemporary of Michael Chekhov. You will be introduced to one of his études – a two minute repeatable exercise used to develop balance, awareness and expression. Responding to video guidance you will be invited to explore your own response to this unique approach to training and will share these with the experts and your fellow students. Together we will reflect on these responses, evaluating the importance of Meyerhold’s work today.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-others-say\">What others say</h3>\n\n<p>This is a re-run of this highly successful course. Here are just a few of the comments taken from a longer review written by Claire Warden, author of ‘British Avant-Garde Theatre’ who took the course in March 2014</p>\n\n<p>“…I can honestly say that the past week has been a revelation. Not only has the teaching been clear, it has also attacked such a range of ideas in an intellectually rigorous way…”</p>\n\n<p>“I studied alongside students from across the world…The supportive, cross-cultural community…was wholly unexpected and reflected Meyerhold’s transnational intentions”</p>\n\n<p>“An amazing course that has been thoroughly enjoyable and informative”</p>\n\n<p>The following comment is one of many similar comments made by other students who joined the course in March.</p>\n\n<p>“My grateful thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make such an enriching experience possible - first rate!”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"accreditation\">Accreditation</h3>\n\n<p>This course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles. By completing the course you will have achieved 12 hours of CPD time.</p>\n\n<p>This optional formal exam has been set by the team at the University of Leeds and is based on the contents of the course. You will be able to sit the exam at various test centres across the world after the end of the course. You can choose from exam dates between Monday 9 March and Sunday 29 March.</p>\n\n<p>The course is for anyone interested in physical theatre. You may be a student at school or college thinking of going on to university or you may be at university wanting to widen your areas of interest and experience. Alternatively, you may be a teacher, an actor or theatre professional or a life-long learner in the performing arts with an active curiosity for history and theatre training.</p>\n\n<p>There will be some movement work, so students need to be of sound physical health, but the physical actions to be explored in the course are manageable for anyone with an average capacity for movement – lifting the arms, rotating the hips, shifting weight from one leg to the next. No previous experience of physical theatre is necessary.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media"],"educator":"Jonathan Pitches","organisation":{"url":"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/","name":"University of Leeds","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/4c/8f/4c8f5c11-3022-4c5f-a1c6-b3a88ffc4c14.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2197546/video","runs":[{"uuid":"dfc61aa5-96a7-4909-8a03-78c19413b4a9","start_date":"2014-03-10","duration_in_weeks":3},{"uuid":"cfe69fa6-5b8b-4836-bb23-5ed4502f2725","start_date":"2015-01-26","duration_in_weeks":3}]},{"uuid":"7e267675-2efc-488b-9267-495965dc7f00","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/managing-people?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/9c/df/regular_9cdf858f-a6a0-4b45-8e81-6d5563f36f78.jpg","name":"Managing People: Engaging Your Workforce","introduction":"Learn how to understand and get the most out of people in the workplace, with a course that's ideal for those in management roles.","description":"<p>In this ten-week course you will learn how to get the most out of people in the workplace. Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.”<br>\nAgha Hasan Abedi</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet”<br>\nHenry Mintzberg</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\">Who is this course for?</h3>\n<p>The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial.</p>\n\n<p>The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-might-i-learn-and-how-might-this-benefit-me\">What might I learn and how might this benefit me?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to manage people and get them engaged.</li>\n  <li>How to get the best out of people.</li>\n  <li>What good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection.</li>\n  <li>Tools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-will-the-learning-experience-be-like-and-what-will-be-expected-of-me\">What will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me?</h3>\n<p>The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience.</p>\n\n<p>You must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches.

You’ll be exploring a number of topics that address many issues including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is food security really just about food? </li>\n<li>Should we have concerns about health, social justice, environmental degradation and cultural diversity? </li>\n<li>What is the role of technology and innovation in promoting food security? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And much more.</p>\n\n<p>In the final week we explore the big picture by considering food systems and food chains as a whole.

We also consider the issue of food poverty and how this fits within the food security debate.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the hashtag <strong>#FLfoodsecurity</strong> to join and contribute to Twitter conversations about this course.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Bill Davies has written a <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/global-food-security-we-are-all-part-of-the-problem-and-we-can-all-be-part-of-the-solution/\">blog post</a> about the course in which he argues that we need a new “Green Revolution” if we’re going to feed the world’s growing population.</p>\n\n<p>There are no requirements for this course except an interest in global food security</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment","Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Bill Davies","organisation":{"url":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk","name":"Lancaster University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/47/74/47742afd-0804-4cb4-8a1e-7b228d84ca91.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2550056/video","runs":[{"uuid":"1d2ae595-e986-4efa-bf41-af1bcfbe0892","start_date":"2014-05-12","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"4fa99f47-f514-47c8-bd37-6131180045b0","start_date":"2015-08-31","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"6422ab19-136d-41eb-8927-23f4c807d9bb","start_date":"2016-08-29","duration_in_weeks":8}]},{"uuid":"5a6805bb-c5c9-4452-ba15-df93f706fea0","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hadrians-wall?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/fe/a9/regular_fea9b9a3-bed1-4ec2-9af6-ba1148e29aea.jpg","name":"Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier","introduction":"Explore the archaeology of the most heavily fortified frontier in the Roman Empire, its people and their lives.","description":"<p>Explore the archaeology of the most heavily fortified frontier in the Roman Empire, its people and their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Hadrian’s Wall stretches over 73 miles (117 km), from coast to coast in what is now Northern England. The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the factors that determine the survival of evidence</li>\n  <li>the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation</li>\n  <li>the planning of archaeological projects</li>\n  <li>excavation techniques</li>\n  <li>and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome’s most famous frontier.</p>\n\n<p>Find out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/how-learners-are-helping-shape-our-courses-about-hadrians-wall\">FutureLearn blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended for anyone with an interest in the archaeology or history of the Roman Empire.

The same ideas can be applied to economic and financial systems.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modelling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently entrepreneurship. Finally, relating this all back together in two case studies will conclude the course. The first case study is financial stability and crises and the latter is growth and development of cities.</p>\n\n<p>By completing this course you will have developed skills and knowledge that will enhance your decision-making skills in order to act in a complex world and under uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This course has received a major update in 2016 with added content on agent-based modelling, entrepreneurship and city planning.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyone should be able to participate in course. However, basic knowledge of economic, financial institutions, mathematics and logic will be helpful. The course will be taught at undergraduate level.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Science, Engineering & Maths"],"educator":"Lex Hoogduin","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7064059/video","runs":[{"uuid":"b9d01871-a3f9-45c9-994b-29461002cab6","start_date":"2014-09-15","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"1cd3114e-4a13-4157-9a1c-3a19fbf7e406","start_date":"2015-01-19","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"4445ee60-bb4f-456a-bfa2-bf0af1697ee5","start_date":"2015-09-21","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"5e7235b4-374e-4fcf-ac68-e67d3441909a","start_date":"2016-09-05","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"23c5b3a2-d869-4ec8-99a8-c5d5cf0854bf","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/football?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/90/2d/regular_902d0c48-095e-4919-81aa-4b8f4d3f198c.jpg","name":"Football: More than a Game","introduction":"Explore the role of football in the world today - including finances, clubs, nations and rivalries - with this free online course.","description":"<h2 id=\"explore-footballs-role-in-society-today\">Explore football’s role in society today</h2>\n\n<p>Where did football come from, and where is it going?

You’ll watch videos, read articles, answer questions, do tests and quizzes, and discuss problems with other learners and help them with their problems too.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll learn maths skills like: calculus (integration, differentiation, and solving differential equations); trigonometry (e.g. resolving forces); and geometry (calculating where things are).  You’ll learn laws of physics like Newton’s laws of motion and the laws of thermodynamics.  Finally, you’ll see how these tools and principles allow engineers to design: planes, cars, skyscrapers, bridges, dams, ICT networks, self-healing materials, robots, water treatment systems, wind turbines, hydro-power systems, biofuel plants.</p>\n\n<p>The course is designed to be adaptable to your needs with quick questions (to check knowledge) and optional work sheets (so you can focus on areas that are new to you or practise skills that you want to improve).

According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.</p>\n\n<p>Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will have acquired the knowledge and analytical skills to develop critical insights into one of the most urgent issues of today’s world: the various roles of religion in conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed for undergraduate learners who are interested in analysing the relationship between religion and conflict from a social scientific perspective.

Managing these supply chains has become more and more a challenge, especially with all modern technologies and todays trends. The 24-hour economy, fast delivery of goods to your home, wanting to have customized products and of course the focus on sustainability are a few of these trends.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will learn why managing supply chains is important and challenging. It is a key activity for both large multi-national companies as well as for small businesses. We’ll find out how to design supply chains that meet future economic, environmental and social requirements, asking questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How did global supply chain become what they are today?</li>\n  <li>How can current information and communication technology (ICT) make supply chains more efficient?</li>\n  <li>Which trends do we need to recognize and cope with?</li>\n  <li>How can you implement sustainable supply chain innovations?</li>\n  <li>And what impact will sensing technologies, such as the use of RFID, have on the supply chain?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will look at examples from the food industry. Also, the building and construction supply chain will be discussed since it has a big impact. One out of three trucks is construction related so innovations applied on this chain can have a huge impact.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be encouraged to apply the knowledge you gain to your own product or industry (or a company and supply chain you’re interested in). You are invited to share your ideas for optimizing your supply chain with other learners.</p>\n\n<p>Together with academics from the University of Twente and experts from industry, you’ll learn how to innovate supply chains. These instructors have vast experience in integrating ICT and extensive research in supply chain process optimization, innovation and management.</p>\n\n<p>Supply chain is a cross disciplinary area. In this course we give a broad overview rather than focusing on detailed quantitative/mathematical or ICT skills. Although we’ll challenge you to perform some basic modelling and technology activities, the focus is on thinking supply chain and recognizing the impact of ICT so that you can be an innovator in this area and a driver of change. Key to a good supply chain manager is his/her ability to think across company borders and functional domains. In addition, being interested in both business and technology is essential.</p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at professionals and students in disciplines such as ICT, operations, marketing, finance,.. who wish to learn more about supply chain management. Supply chain management and operations professionals and students that want to learn from about new trends and technologies can also benefit from the course. As we are all end customers of supply chains and the impact of supply chains on our world is enormous, many of us wish to know what is happening behind the scene.

It will help you analyse the themes in these fairy tales, and give you the possibility to discuss the author’s relationship with his own age as well as his cross-cultural importance today, as the inspiration behind many popular books and movies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interpret-hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales-with-experts-from-his-birthplace\">Interpret Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales with experts from his birthplace</h3>\n\n<p>You will learn with experts from the HC Andersen Center at the University of Southern Denmark – an internationally renowned research institution located in the writer’s birthplace, Odense.</p>\n\n<p>Each week, these experts will guide discussions, analyses and interpretations of one or more of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The Tinderbox</li>\n  <li>The Travelling Companion</li>\n  <li>The Little Mermaid</li>\n  <li>The Snow Queen (the inspiration for Disney’s Frozen)</li>\n  <li>The Story of a Mother</li>\n  <li>The Red Shoes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>New English translations of the fairy tales will be used. You can download them from this <a href=\"http://andersen.sdu.dk/mooc/%20\" title=\"Title\">website</a> .</p>\n\n<p>You will explore the themes of each story, and investigate how they both conform with and digress from the basic elements of the fairy tale and the folk tale.</p>\n\n<p>The fairy tale genre became very popular in the period of literary history to which Hans Christian Andersen belongs, Romanticism, when childhood was discovered as an age that is important in its own right. What Hans Christian Andersen did with this genre is absolutely unique - there are no other writers of fairy tales like him.</p>\n\n<p>Through the course, you will understand how Hans Christian Andersen’s authorship developed. From the rewriting of old folk tales via self-invented fairy tales to his so-called new fairy tales characterized by a modern approach.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-hans-christian-andersens-enduring-universal-appeal\">Explore Hans Christian Andersen’s enduring, universal appeal</h3>\n\n<p>Hans Christian Andersen often described himself as a “bog plant” – his roots were figuratively speaking deeply anchored in mire and mud, his very humble beginnings, but he constantly stretched up for the light of the sun, ie. for acceptance and recognition as an artist and a writer. And in fact he  grew from these humble beginnings to achieve fame and acknowledgement as an artist in both Europe and America while he was still alive.

Can we ensure that these principles are implemented wisely?</p>\n\n<p>This free online course will look at risk management in its broadest terms, giving you the opportunity to evaluate the crucial role played by risk in the global economy, both in terms of its opportunities and its potential dangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-financial-investments-and-the-associated-risks\">Understand financial investments and the associated risks</h3>\n<p>With experts from the Centre for Financial and Management Studies at SOAS University of London, you’ll look at practical examples of financial investments, to examine:</p>\n\n<ul><li>the main functions of finance and of risk management </li>\n<li>the main forms of financial investment, such as stocks and bonds, derivatives, futures and options, hedging and speculation strategies</li>\n<li>how firms hedge risk by using financial derivatives</li>\n<li>how risk management is applied in the financial and in the non-financial sector.</li> </ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-how-the-financial-crisis-and-emerging-markets-are-changing-risk-management\">Learn how the financial crisis and emerging markets are changing risk management</h3>\n<p>The course will explore how finance has changed in recent years, and ask if these changes have resulted in greater systemic risk for the financial sector and for the economy as a whole. By examining concepts such as behavioural finance, we’ll ask if inappropriate risk management has exacerbated the recent financial crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we’ll turn our attention to new and emerging markets. For example, how is risk managed in Islamic finance? How might common tools alter risk in investment positions in mature markets as well as in the banking sector? And how can firms utilise risk management tools most effectively?</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the four-week course, you’ll be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>understand financial markets and the principles of risk management</li>\n<li>understand the main types of risk and evaluate the methods and tools used by firms to manage risks</li> \n<li>examine ideas and methods used in the analysis of portfolios of financial securities, including stocks and bonds</li>\n<li>explain the use of financial derivatives for hedging (reducing risk) and speculation (increasing risk) in financial markets</li> \n<li>evaluate the application of risk methods and risk management tools in the global economy</li></ul>\n\n<p>The course offers a broad overview of risk, and will be of interest to those looking to better understand financial instruments and their impact on the global economy.</p>\n\n<p>This is a general level course, however some knowledge of economics or finance may be useful.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management"],"educator":"Pasquale Scaramozzino","organisation":{"url":"http://www.soas.ac.uk/","name":"SOAS University of London","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f4/da/f4daa6f0-4cbb-464d-909f-7eb155b67d82.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7807006/video","runs":[{"uuid":"8e0b48cf-8885-4bcd-aaef-2d81dcd57e4f","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"3490383e-830b-4da8-b867-c402be84d50b","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/digital-accessibility?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/8a/ac/regular_8aac90ee-f4fe-4f7d-b079-583013748ce1.jpg","name":"Digital Accessibility: Enabling Participation in the Information Society","introduction":"With a better understanding of users' needs, technologies can be developed to be accessible & provide a more inclusive environment","description":"<p>This course will help you to understand how those with sensory, physical and cognitive impairments may be disabled by barriers encountered when using digital technologies.

The reading load will be flexible, and you will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and feelings via the online discussions with other learners.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we’ll explore six themes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Stress:</strong> In poetry, the word “stress” refers to the emphasis of certain syllables in a poem’s metre. How might the metrical “stresses” of poetry help us to cope with the mental and emotional stresses of modern life?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Heartbreak:</strong> Is heartbreak a medical condition? What can Sidney’s sonnets and Austen’s <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> teach us about suffering and recovering from a broken heart?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Bereavement:</strong> The psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross famously proposed that there are five stages of grief. How might Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> and poems by Wordsworth and Hardy help us to think differently about the process of grieving?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Trauma:</strong> PTSD or “shellshock” has long been associated with the traumatic experiences of soldiers in World War 1. How is the condition depicted in war poetry of the era? Can poems and plays offer us an insight into other sources of trauma, including miscarriage and assault?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Depression and Bipolar:</strong> The writer Rachel Kelly subtitles her memoir <em>Black Rainbow</em> “how words healed me – my journey through depression”. Which texts have people turned to during periods of depression, and why? What can we learn from literature about the links between bipolar disorder and creativity?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Ageing and Dementia:</strong> One of the greatest studies of ageing in English Literature is Shakespeare’s <em>King Lear</em>. Is it helpful to think about this play in the context of dementia? Why are sufferers of age-related memory loss often still able to recall the poems they have learned “by heart”?</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Leading you through the course and readings will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Dr Paula Byrne:</strong> One of the world’s leading Jane Austen experts, who conceived of this course while researching how Austen’s novels were prescribed to victims of shellshock in World War 1.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Professor Jonathan Bate:</strong> A critic, biographer and reviewer; Man Booker Prize judge; and author of a prize-winning biography of the poet, John Clare, and <em>Being Shakespeare</em> - the hit one-man play for Simon Callow. Jonathan is also the Lead Educator on the immensely successful <em><a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world\">Shakespeare and his World</a></em> FutureLearn course.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Along the way, you’ll also hear from doctors, who offer a medical perspective on the conditions discussed in the course, as well as from a range people who have turned to literature at moments of crisis, including such well-known figures as Melvyn Bragg, Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have the opportunity to share your own experiences, discover new texts, and take part in activities that explore the relationship between reading and wellbeing.

Here are just a few of the wonderful comments learners have said about the course so far:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I [have] loved this course, thank you. It has reminded me of the power of words to lift us up and that express emotions and conditions that can be hard to deal with. I have been inspired to read and write more poetry as a result. Thank you again!” - Susan Perry</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Thoroughly enjoyed the course and found it really rewarding. Excellent content and food for thought. I can’t praise it highly enough. I’m now totally convinced about the impact literature can have on mental health. I know it will help more people in future - literature, art and music has a tremendous power to help healing and promote mental well-being. It is a lifeline and a wonderful coping mechanism. It’s been great to learn from and share experiences with all the delegates too.” - Dr. Rachael Turner</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I have have enjoyed this course immensely. It’s given me a new outlook on life and even the courage to read new and exciting things and to even enjoy a wider range of materials I’ve ever thought of. A really wonderful experience and I’ve loved the feedback and comments from fellow course members.” - Amanda Bedwell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This course is open to anyone with an interest in literature or mental health. No previous experience or qualifications are required.</p>\n\n<p>We suggest that this course should take around 4 hours per week to complete, but this is a guideline figure only, and will vary depending on how much time you spend in engaging in the course discussions, and on whether or not you choose to read any of the longer course texts in their entirety.</p>\n\n<p>All of the texts that we discuss during the course will be provided online in the weekly course materials. We’ll be focusing on poems, as well as on some short extracts from plays and novels, so there’s no need to do any reading in advance.

They are instruments of communication and are often a source of dignity and of human pride. Our life experiences and views of the world are bound up in our languages. Our sense of self might be strengthened by our ability to speak the language we choose or curtailed by our inability to understand the language that speaks to us. Some scholars even say that the right to speak one’s languages should be established as an essential part of the right to be oneself. They suggest that this language right should be honoured in all forms of communication.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will explore how people’s language practice, and the personal connection people have to the language(s) they speak, provoke important philosophical and pedagogical questions around the ways we form personal relationships, engage in business relations and even view the world around us.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-how-languages-challenge-the-way-we-live\">Explore how languages challenge the way we live</h3>\n\n<p>English is the language of worldwide communication.

Data science and computational modelling for policy makers:</strong> we will look at so-called “policy informatics” – the new, policy-oriented methods of modelling complex systems on computers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Citizen engagement:</strong> a central concept of GSS is that the behaviour of social systems emerges bottom-up, from the interactions of individuals and institutions, in the context of top-down policy constraints. We will explore what this means in practice – why individual citizens must be involved in decision making and policy formulation.</p>\n\n<p>Because no method can provide perfect knowledge of the outcomes of policy, we will end with a critical evaluation of Global Systems Science, helping you understand its capabilities, limitations and future development.</p>\n\n<p>No prior knowledge is required for this course.

Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You’ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also look at the structure of the virus in more detail, seeing how the study of influenza is now carried out at the molecular level.</p>\n\n<p>As well as mini-lectures, there will be laboratory demonstrations, interviews with experts in a variety of relevant fields, and discussion sessions, where you’ll be invited to contribute your own experiences and opinions to the subject of flu, and how we should treat and prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more in Dr Derek Gatherer’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/do-i-have-the-flu/\">Do I have the flu?

As such this course combines an overview of Just War Theory with an introduction to key principles of ethics that can aid military professionals in facing every day ethical challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Over seven weeks, we will explore six topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Foundations in ethical theory</li>\n<li>Ethics within the military profession</li>\n<li>Going to war</li>\n<li>The conduct of war</li>\n<li>Military and society</li>\n<li>Ethics, technology and war</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Specific topics addressed include role morality, illegal orders and whistleblowing, the competing duties of military commanders and the ethical challenges arising from new technologies such as unmanned and autonomous weapons systems, non-lethal weapons, and cyberwarfare.</p>\n\n<p>Leading military ethicist Deane-Peter Baker travels around the world exploring key issues and case studies and speaking with international ethicists, military professionals, historians, philosophers, government and NGO personnel to build a comprehensive introduction to this essential field. This course is a must for military professionals, civilian policy makers, journalists, NGO personnel and anyone interested in the appropriate conduct of military affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone with an interest in military ethics is welcome and encouraged to participate in this course. We start with a brief introduction to relevant ethical theories, so no specific background knowledge is required.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World","History"],"educator":"Deane-Peter Baker","organisation":{"url":"https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/","name":"UNSW Canberra","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f2/b3/f2b3191a-9044-4b87-9d12-de04385307c8.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5387660/video","runs":[{"uuid":"e43b65cb-8967-47ee-8cef-8c1db185818b","start_date":"2016-02-29","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"39c861b4-f543-45ba-ad14-39b515add88b","start_date":"2016-08-01","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"bce852a4-13a1-4af6-99bb-da1db4da392a","start_date":"2017-02-06","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"fed95197-ffa2-4b75-87ab-524a6d75bcc3","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/ww1-lessons-legacy?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e1/4a/regular_e14ae70f-bd1a-47d8-b50d-adc5a53d0c61.jpg","name":"World War 1: Lessons and Legacy of the Great War","introduction":"Learn how the Allies defeat the Germans in World War 1, how the memory arose that the war was futile, and why this view is untrue.","description":"<p>What is your understanding of World War I? Brave men led to their deaths by stupid officers? A war of trenches, mud and barbed wire in which there was no victor?</p>\n\n<p>In this short, free online course, we offer you the opportunity to uncover both the mechanics and the memory of the Great War. Focusing on the Western Front, the most important and bloody theatre of the war, we will examine how the Allied armies experienced a ‘learning curve’. We will see how they integrated new training, techniques and technologies, to end the stalemate of trench warfare, defeat the German invader and liberate Belgium and northern France from four hard years of military occupation.</p>\n\n<p>The course compares and contrasts the reality of the First World War - a costly and wasteful conflict, but one that ended in a decisive victory over German aggression - with  our memory of it today, a war that was both senseless and ineffective. Throughout, we will focus on the experiences of soldiers in the British, French, German and American armies, as these formed the majority of soldiers on the Western Front. This includes soldiers from the British and French empires, including Australian, Canadian, Indian, New Zealand, Algerian, Moroccan and West African soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn with John Connor, one of Australia’s leading military historians, and a team of international historians. They will draw on the latest historical research to offer new insights and engage with old myths, helping you understand a conflict that, despite occurring a century ago, still resonates with people today.</p>\n\n<p>The course is presented in three parts:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1: An overview of the Great War</strong>. We concentrate on the conflict on the Western Front, and explore the development of an unprecedented type of combat, trench warfare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: The ‘learning curve’</strong>. In this section we compare how the British, French and German armies attempted to end the stalemate of trench warfare by developing new technology, training and tactics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: Remembering the First World War</strong>. We explore how the social and political landscape has shaped and changed the memory of the War over the last century, and how art, poetry and novels have contributed to that understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Image credit: with permission from <a href=\"http://digital.nls.uk/74548990\">National Library of Scotland</a>.</p>\n\n<p>No particular background is required; everyone with an interest in the First World War is welcome to participate in the course.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"John Connor","organisation":{"url":"https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/","name":"UNSW Canberra","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f2/b3/f2b3191a-9044-4b87-9d12-de04385307c8.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5356990/video","runs":[{"uuid":"3fed39b5-cdf3-46fa-b325-0d36e9d8a5f7","start_date":"2016-02-08","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"709bc79d-9afd-4238-bf93-c59f1f48ee2a","start_date":"2016-08-29","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"fa273fbb-cbdf-4fec-87b4-3701d9fcd18a","start_date":"2017-01-30","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"fb71a629-2346-42c8-92a2-9c9746b3c3d2","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/crime-justice-society?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/a4/08/regular_a4085e9b-8156-4c36-b135-378813639661.jpg","name":"Crime, Justice and Society","introduction":"Explore the role of the state in regulating criminal behaviour and the parts played by those in the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\n","description":"<p>##</p>\n\n<p>There are few policy areas that are underpinned by more myths and misconceptions or generate more heated debate than <em>Crime, Justice and Society</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What should the role of the police be?

Each subculture sits within a broader ‘parent’ culture and can often give us an insight into cultural fears and hopes, especially in the youth of the population.</p>\n\n<p>On this course you will get an introduction to Japanese subcultures that have developed since the 1970s.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-different-aspects-of-japanese-subcultures\">Explore different aspects of Japanese subcultures</h2>\n<p>Japanese subculture has been long considered as ephemeral youth culture compared to authentic traditional culture. It contains, however, subversive power which encourages younger generations to re-create the world they live in. We mainly focus on the significance of <strong>immaturity</strong> and <strong>vulnerability</strong> of youth which eventually give permission to younger people (in other words, minorities) to stay as they are.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, together with three other specialists, <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4059657\">Professor Niijima</a>, <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/4057585\">Professor Takahashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/2141961\">Professor Ohwada</a>, we will explore girls comics, boys comics, the <em>Hatsune Miku</em> vocaloid, cosplay, and J-pop idols, focusing on the themes such as <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Battle</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong> and <strong>Fan culture</strong>, in which you’ll learn about the different cultural creations that underpin Japanese subcultures.

Through books, an abundance of information, including the knowledge and experiences of the people of the past, has been handed down to the present. But books are more than records of words and images. Their form, appearance, and even the scripts and styles used tell us about the fashions and technologies of the times that produced them. By studying old books, we can learn a great deal about the geographical areas in which they were made, the historical background, and the individuals and groups involved in their making.</p>\n\n<p>While displaying remarkable similarities with books produced in other areas of the Sinitic cultural sphere, Japanese books also possess some unique features, starting with their sheer diversity of form and appearance. Using a wealth of multimedia content, we will take a journey through the wonderful world of traditional Japanese books.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"keio-universitys-book-collection\">Keio University’s Book Collection</h2>\n<p>Keio University’s Institute of Oriental Classics is a unique institution specialized in rare East Asian books. The Institute’s extensive collection comprises 163,000 items, and is open to the public as a specialized library. In this course we will make use of this rich collection and rely on the expertise of specialists and researchers who have been working for the preservation and study of these resources. Using state of the art media resources, you will familiarize yourself with not only the content of traditional East Asian books, but also with their physical appearance, format, binding method, script, and cover style.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-about-bookbinding-styles-and-their-influence-on-japanese-literature\">Learn about bookbinding styles and their influence on Japanese literature</h2>\n<p>In the first week of the course, you will be introduced to the main bookbinding methods used in traditional Asia, and to the practice of rebinding books. We will also discuss the influence of Chinese bookbinding methods on early Japanese books in all their various shapes and forms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-old-japanese-manuscripts-and-illustrated-books-in-high-resolution-images-and-videos\">Explore old Japanese manuscripts and illustrated books in high-resolution images and videos</h2>\n<p>In the second week of the course, we will focus primarily on the different types of manuscripts and illustrated books that were used for waka (classical Japanese poetry) and prose tales (monogatari) from the 9th century through the 17th century. High quality images and video recordings of materials in Keio University’s book collection and beyond will give you a real sense of the look and feel of these precious objects.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discover-the-role-of-book-publishing-in-the-development-of-japanese-literature-and-scholarship\">Discover the role of book publishing in the development of Japanese literature and scholarship</h2>\n<p>In the final week of this course, we will look at how the introduction of movable-type and woodblock printing in the 17th and 18th centuries helped books spread widely across social classes, and how this democratization of books affected Edo culture and learning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"develop-your-interests-in-japan-and-rare-books\">Develop your interests in Japan and rare books</h2>\n<p>By the end of this course, you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be inspired to further explore the field of rare books.</li>\n  <li>have a good understanding of the various types of traditional Japanese books and their history.</li>\n  <li>have developed a unique perspective on the origins and development of Japanese culture through book history.</li>\n  <li>be familiar with the role of universities and research institutions in preserving and studying rare books and manuscripts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is an introductory course and is open to anyone with an interest in the history of Japanese books.

Over six weeks, we will look at the background of disability and strategies for creating an enabling environment in the school and community.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn in a variety of ways, from short video lectures, readings and discussions, to online quizzes. Each will introduce different perspectives in the inclusive education framework and help you to apply inclusive education in your own context.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-from-people-with-experience-of-disability\">Learn from people with experience of disability</h3>\n\n<p>From challenging perceptions of disability to everyday classroom practices, this course will offer you insights from a range of people who have worked with disabled children - parents, teachers, facilitators, occupational and allied therapists and school principals.</p>\n\n<p>You will also learn from established educators. Dr Judith McKenzie is a lecturer and researcher at the University of Cape Town who has taught and published extensively on disability and inclusive education; she has worked in rural areas focusing on community based and interdisciplinary efforts to address disability, exclusion and poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Chioma Ohajunwa has a B.Ed in Special Education and Language Arts and an MPhil in Disability Studies and has worked in various contexts ranging from educare for disabled children in Nigeria and Liberia, to disabilities studies in South African higher education.</p>\n\n<p>In the words of American educator, Dr Kevin Maxwell, “Our job is to teach the kids we have. Not the ones we would like to have. Not the ones we used to have. Those we have right now…all of them.”  This course will help you teach all of our children, right now.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"course-outline\">Course outline:</h3>\n\n<p>●      Week 1 - Why inclusion?<br>\n●      Week 2 - Education begins at home<br>\n●      Week 3 - Creating an inclusive school <br>\n●      Week 4 - Partnerships for success<br>\n●      Week 5 - Changing classroom practices<br>\n●      Week 6 - Building networks</p>\n\n<p>The course is aimed at teachers, other professionals and parents interested in developing inclusive education.</p>\n\n<p>If you are part of a community wanting to develop inclusive education in a school, you could form a group to support each other’s learning (either virtual or physical). Use this course to try out some of the strategies suggested for developing an inclusive education environment and we will provide additional resources for those wanting to implement inclusive education principles and practices.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Teaching"],"educator":"Judith McKenzie","organisation":{"url":"https://www.uct.ac.za/","name":"University of Cape Town","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/21/1f/211f336a-47ca-4404-b2f0-49dfb6cd0b58.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/6187241/video","runs":[{"uuid":"b3398b44-f1ca-4a0b-bc86-3243592a8495","start_date":"2016-04-04","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"74f66b52-008e-41b6-9099-14ec552ee6de","start_date":"2016-09-19","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"f5530f8c-f498-4984-ad22-2f3dce341df1","start_date":"2017-04-10","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"1dbee08c-f224-4b74-877e-9956354c8109","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-drugs-and-addiction-chinese?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/17/ac/regular_17acce3e-4213-43f8-a6cc-92680f78af22.jpg","name":"了解药物以及成瘾","introduction":"成瘾是如何形成的？戒掉瘾症和避免染上瘾症的最好方式是什么？参加这门免费的在线课程，探索这些关键问题。","description":"<p>Understanding Drugs and Addiction, is also running in English, starting 7 March 2016.

Als je bijvoorbeeld de dagelijkse boodschappen afrekent bij de kassa, ben je jezelf er wellicht niet direct van bewust dat er steeds een wederkerige verbintenisscheppende overeenkomst tot stand komt tussen jou en de supermarkt. Daaruit vloeien veel meer rechten en plichten voort dan alleen het leveren van de boodschappen en het betalen daarvoor.</p>\n\n<p>Juist omdat het recht zo veel invloed heeft op het leven van alledag, komt enige juridische kennis steeds van pas.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ben je in het recht geïnteresseerd, bijvoorbeeld omdat je daarmee in je werk- of privéomgeving regelmatig in aanraking komt?</li>\n  <li>Ben je op zoek naar de juiste studie, of wil je binnen je eigen studie je horizon verbreden?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dan is deze introducerende cursus interessant voor jou!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-tijdens-deze-cursus-gaat-doen\">Wat je tijdens deze cursus gaat doen</h3>\n<p>Door middel van video’s, artikelen, oefenvragen en discussies maak je de komende vijf weken jouw eerste stappen in de wereld van het recht.</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>eerste week</strong> legt de basis waarop we de rest van de weken voortbouwen. Wat is recht? Waar kun je het vinden? Hoe kun je het vinden? Je gaat zelf wetten en rechterlijke uitspraken opzoeken, lezen en gebruiken om je argumenten bij een juridische zaak goed te onderbouwen. Deze vaardigheden komen niet alleen gedurende deze cursus van pas, maar ook al direct in het dagelijks leven!</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>tweede week</strong> gaat over een heel zichtbaar deel van het recht: het staatsrecht. Wie maakt de regels? Hoe verhoudt de Tweede Kamer zich tot de regering? Je gaat op ontdekkingsreis in de Grondwet en leert wat de uitwerking is van grondrechten. Is het ene grondrecht belangrijker dan het andere? Betekent de vrijheid van meningsuiting dat je alles mag zeggen? En zijn er mensen die méér mogen zeggen dan anderen?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>derde week</strong> leer je meer over schade en aansprakelijkheid. Waarom kun je beter niet zomaar een kelderluik in een café open laten staan? En waarom moet je soms toch iemands schade vergoeden terwijl het niet jouw schuld was? En – ook belangrijk – wanneer hoeft dat niet?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>vierde week</strong> leer je wanneer en hoe je jezelf kunt verweren tegen de machtige overheid. Hoe ziet ‘het bestuur’ van ons land er precies uit? En wat kun je doen als je van de burgemeester geen project X-feestje mag houden? Of als je geen bouwvergunning voor een nieuwe dakkapel krijgt?</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>vijfde week</strong> gaat over een onderdeel van het recht waar je waarschijnlijk meteen aan denkt bij het woord ‘recht’: het strafrecht. Er komen vragen aan de orde als: wanneer bega je een strafbaar feit? Kun je de staf ontlopen door een ‘vormfout’? Wanneer en hoe intensief mag je jezelf of een ander verdedigen tegen een aanval?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-na-deze-cursus-kunt\">Wat je na deze cursus kunt</h3>\n<p>Na afloop van de cursus ben je in staat om:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>uit te leggen wat ‘recht’ is aan de hand van de functies, de bronnen en de indeling van het recht;</li>\n  <li>verschillende rechtsgebieden van elkaar te onderscheiden;</li>\n  <li>enkele juridische basisbegrippen te herkennen en te beschrijven;</li>\n  <li>wetgeving en uitspraken van rechters op te zoeken en op elementair niveau te analyseren;</li>\n  <li>basale juridische problemen op te lossen en de oplossing te motiveren aan de hand van wetsartikelen en rechterlijke uitspraken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Schrijf je nu in en doe mee!</strong></p>\n\n<p>De online cursus Inleiding Nederlands Recht is bedoeld voor iedereen die geïnteresseerd is in het recht en weinig tot geen voorkennis heeft. De cursus is bij uitstek geschikt voor degene die op  het werk, tijdens de studie of in de privé-omgeving regelmatig met het recht in aanraking komt. Ook voor studiekiezers is dit een interessante eerste kennismaking met het recht.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Law"],"educator":"Adriaan Wierenga","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8118661/video","runs":[{"uuid":"dcd2dac1-8fa9-49ea-8e7e-cacf3c34d772","start_date":"2016-05-30","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"7be445d6-0eb7-4607-affd-b4e06bc7ee79","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"50f7f339-9f44-4809-824c-3ddeba4b11d8","start_date":"2017-03-13","duration_in_weeks":5}]},{"uuid":"030d43f9-19f7-41c6-887e-07c44e957512","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/animal-viruses?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/76/2d/regular_762d9cfc-95fb-4d68-aaf1-10a747d1d251.jpg","name":"Animal Viruses: Their Transmission and the Diseases They Produce","introduction":"Learn how important animal viruses are transmitted between animals and humans, and understand the diseases they produce.\r\n","description":"<p>In this free online course, you will learn about animal viruses that affect pets, birds, sheep, cattle, swine and horses, and produce important diseases.</p>\n\n<p>These animal diseases may cause huge economic losses to farmers and severe emotional distress to animal owners.

The core question addressed during this module is:</p>\n\n<p>What challenges does planetary urbanisation present in different geographical settings and how can cities be made more liveable for future generations?</p>\n\n<p>The key questions we address are:</p>\n<li>What is urbanisation?</li>\n<li>What is planetary urbanisation?</li>\n<li>What kinds of challenges face cities globally today?</li>\n<li>What might future cities look like?</li>\n\n<p>In addressing this students will be asked to consider how is planetary urbanisation different? \nHow are we responding to global urban challenges? \nWill future cities be more liveable?</p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at the equivalent of first or second year undergraduate students. It is an introductory module and no prior knowledge of urban studies, geography, sociology or planning is required.

New illnesses seem to spread faster than ever thanks to interconnected ecosystems and the close connections between humans and animals. Stressing this interconnectedness, One Health seeks an integrative approach to human and animal health. This course will explore this approach and examine the value of it - as well as explain how One Health strategies work in practice.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will attempt to answer some key questions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are the many advantages of a closer cooperation between human and animal health?</li>\n  <li>What transdisciplinary processes can be set up to solve a particular One Health problem efficiently?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"understand-the-concept-of-one-health\">Understand the concept of One Health</h5>\n\n<p>The One Health concept has gained momentum in recent decades, spurred for instance by the Avian Influenza pandemic or by concerns regarding wildlife conservation.

After this course you’ll be able to not only explain what One Health is, you’ll be able to explain how this engagement is carried out, for example in collection of vaccination coverage data or food safety enhancement.

The course reflects this and brings together different disciplines in a selection of case studies, demonstrating the advantages of a closer cooperation between human and animal health and social and cultural sciences. You will learn how to calculate the added value resulting from this approach.</p>\n\n<p>We are very happy to announce that in this course you may take part in a competition in order <strong>to win one of three travel grants</strong>.

Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a ‘boiling point.’ Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States’  “rebalance” toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-regional-cooperation-and-economy\">Explore regional cooperation and economy</h2>\n<p>From a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China’s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor — the United States.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contemplate-the-future-of-south-korea\">Contemplate the future of South Korea</h2>\n<p>South Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea’s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific. At the same time, the evolving regional order and thus the 21st century global politics would be affected by how South Korea, as one of the key actors of East Asia, behaves toward other regional states.</p>\n\n<p>In this respect, we aim to understand South Korea within the context of complex and important dynamics concerning global politics and the international relations of Asia-Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn with Yong-Soo EUN, Professor of of Political Science and International Studies at Hanyang University, and the Editor-in-Chief <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/series/IRTPA\">Routledge Series, IR Theory and Practice in Asia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about this course and related issues on <a href=\"https://hanyang.academia.edu/YongSooEun\">Yong-Soo’s homepage</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are no special requirements for this course.

Understanding who is important to an organisation – and that’s everybody who has a stake in it in some way – is a really good starting point.

If there’s no plan, how do organisations get people on board? If there’s no plan, what’s the difference between success and failure?  How do you know when things are going off track? Or going well?</p>\n\n<p>Plans are one thing. The people who can make the plans a reality are those with the right knowledge, skills and experience. Without the right person, performing as well as they can in the right job, plans don’t get off the ground.

A central part of the course is therefore to identify, discuss and work with climate change leadership challenges in your own context.</p>\n\n<p>You will create a climate change leadership plan for an organisation or issue that you care about, develop your own capacity as a climate change leader and discover ways to deal with climate change that are in proportion to the scale and urgency of the challenge.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-with-interdisciplinary-climate-change-leaders-at-uppsala-university\">Learn with interdisciplinary climate change leaders at Uppsala University</h2>\n\n<p>The course has been developed by Uppsala University – a broad research university, which makes it particularly suited to investigate interdisciplinary areas such as climate change leadership.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout, you will learn with researchers who approach climate change and leadership from scientific, social and cultural standpoints, giving you the tools for creating change within your own personal and organisational contexts.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed for anyone who wants to take a leading role in tackling climate change. You might work in a small business, an NGO, a university faculty, government or municipality administration - or just be curious.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Nature & Environment"],"educator":"Daniel Mossberg","organisation":{"url":"http://www.uu.se/en","name":"Uppsala University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f3/b5/f3b5e58d-4f7b-449c-8a79-1b5815fec8d3.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8049196/video","runs":[{"uuid":"48c16377-38f2-4b23-aab2-88660ddadbe0","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"bc799fba-1fc8-4477-add4-012143976395","start_date":"2017-04-10","duration_in_weeks":5}]},{"uuid":"7e06a580-d7e0-43fa-bc1a-62ddb8ab468c","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/personal-financial-planning-and-budgeting?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/17/41/regular_1741b37a-d1a3-4c14-bd41-c62861214bef.jpg","name":"Finance Fundamentals: Financial Planning and Budgeting","introduction":"With household budgets feeling the pinch this course shows how to bring order to your finances and make good financial decisions.","description":"<p>Finance Fundamentals: Financial Planning and Budgeting starts by looking at the current economic backcloth and its impact on household finances.

Needless to say, these phenomena have profound social implications that may harm future generations.</p>\n\n<p>This situation raises some major ethical questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>To what extent are human beings entitled to exploit nature for their needs and interests?</li>\n  <li>What kind of shared responsibility is appropriate in addressing climate change?</li>\n  <li>How can we respond to the adverse effects of climate change being experienced by the peoples of the Global South?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The effects of climate change disasters, however, are not only confined to the global south but are also felt by the more affluent sectors of societies or the Global North.</p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve a more sustainable world where nature can continue to support the aspirations for better living conditions for future and disadvantaged generations, a notion of justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature and the human beings’ rights to live and enjoy the fruits of their labor must be formulated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-about-climate-justice\">Learn about climate justice</h2>\n\n<p>Following the recommendation of UNESCO’s World Commission for the Ethics of Science and Technology (COMEST) in the promotion of Biological and Cultural Diversity as starting point of Climate Change Ethics, UNESCO is currently pioneering a worldwide reflection on the ‘ethical principles in relation to climate change’. Along the same line, within its philosophy programme, in 2014 UNESCO published the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002284/228411E.pdf\">“Manual of Philosophy – A South-South Perspective”</a>. This Manual sheds a new light on the singularity of some major philosophical texts and traditions from the Global South.</p>\n\n<p>This course has been built upon these two major undertakings. It will propose a notion of climate justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature, on the one hand, while supporting the biological and economic needs of human populations, on the other hand.  Human needs and ecological integrity, therefore, need not be opposing but more supportive of one another in so far as human beings allow nature to regenerate herself by regulating their excessive consumption of natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>The course proposes groundbreaking reflections on Climate Justice, within the contexts of Biological and Cultural Diversity and the Precautionary Principle, while exploring the Global South’s approaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-how-humans-can-balance-their-needs-with-the-needs-of-the-planet\">Explore how humans can balance their needs with the needs of the planet</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you’ll learn about the various practices of frugality in the global south and enable you to adapt these practices to your own circumstances in view of contributing to the needs of the most vulnerable populations of society.</p>\n\n<p>You will also be able to imagine different ways of extracting natural resources without compromising the regenerating capacity of nature to sustain herself and thus continuously support the needs of all human beings.</p>\n\n<p>There are no special requirements for this course, but an interest in climate change and global justice might be useful.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment","Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Rainier Ibana","organisation":{"url":"http://en.unesco.org/","name":"UNESCO","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/21/0e/210e513f-d31a-4ae0-b47d-32092897bf56.png"},"runs":[{"uuid":"f459df50-d603-4186-9130-cafdb9060f35","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"1a2e04eb-93c5-4e88-b242-3067d2eda6cc","start_date":null,"duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"80b46e3a-fece-46a5-8105-2e3dd5e1ca57","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/european-culture?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/7f/6c/regular_7f6cbd08-46c5-447f-8069-4286928bd5ec.jpg","name":"European Culture and Politics","introduction":"Learn about the link between identity, culture and politics in the construction of contemporary Europe. \r\n","description":"<h2 id=\"this-free-online-course-explains-europe-as-a-cultural-and-political-product\">This free online course explains Europe as a cultural and political product.</h2>\n\n<p>We revisit perceived truths about the meaning of European identity.

Effective participation in our society increasingly requires our ability to engage online. This isn’t just a question of technical ability – just as with our physical society, there are appropriate and responsible behaviours we need to acquire.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we’ll investigate and explore the concept of the digital society. We’ll look at how personal values and ethical judgments shape our online participation, and how new technologies can be applied to solve some of the problems we might face.

We will hear from researchers at the University of York on their experiences of using social media and start to look at how digital technologies enable us to engage beyond the academic audience.  We will also consider the risks of sharing personal information online and bigger issues of information security.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"week-3-digital-participation-and-ethics\">Week 3: Digital participation and ethics</h5>\n<p>Finally, we will look at the use of social media for political discussion and shaping public agendas. We will look at how digital tools can encourage engagement from harder-to-reach groups or non-traditional audiences, exploring both the success stories and the darker forces using this medium for illegal activities. We will also consider netiquette and the importance of open-mindedness and respect, issues of cyberbullying, and our social responsibilities in combating abuse and creating a positive online experience.</p>\n\n<p>The notion of digital citizenship is ubiquitous, and this course therefore aims to be useful to a wide variety of online learners.

Precision medicine. Individualised medicine. Customised medicine. Targeted medicine. All buzzwords of recent years that excite, confuse and infuriate the public, researchers and healthcare professionals. Broadly speaking, these terms all refer to the idea of tailoring treatment to individual patients based on their genetic code.</p>\n\n<p>What does it all mean, and why should you care?</p>\n\n<p>This free online course will discuss both the hype and hope surrounding the genetic revolution and personalised medicine. The impact of personalised medicine on clinical practice will likely yield significant benefits for patients, yet it raises a number of serious ethical and legal issues for health professionals, patients and the community.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-the-power-of-genetics-across-disease-prevention-and-diagnosis\">Explore the power of genetics across disease prevention and diagnosis</h3>\n\n<p>In this unique course you will learn from leading researchers and healthcare professionals how genetic testing is currently used to guide treatment across diseases including <strong>cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and mental health, and infectious disease</strong>.

We will also explore how genes are passed from one generation to the next, basic medical genetics, and how recent technological and scientific advances have heralded the advent of the genetic revolution, and the global approach and impact of these advances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Two:</strong> We will explore the concept of risk and multifactorial disease. We will describe examples of genes that pre-dispose patients to specific diseases, and discuss genetic testing and genetic counselling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Three:</strong> We will investigate the use of personalised medicine today and tease out the reality from the hype. We will also explore the apparent delay between research findings and translation to the clinic - from bench to bedside.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Four:</strong> We will describe the rationale of medical patents, clinical trials, drug approval and regulation, and how these differ in various parts of the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week Five:</strong> We will explore and debate the legal and ethical issues surrounding genetic testing and personalised medicine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"form-your-own-opinion-on-the-genetic-revolution\">Form your own opinion on the genetic revolution</h3>\n\n<p>This course will distill the hype around personalised medicine, and allow you to form your own opinion on the advantages and disadvantages of the genetic revolution. Learning from a wide variety of expert clinicians and researchers currently working in the field, you will be equipped with the language and skills to debate the impact of personalised medicine on your own situation.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone interested in learning about personalised medicine. No particular background in science or medicine is required.

Or how they make money to live their daily lives, just like other people?  This course will explore the <strong>process of creators becoming professionals</strong>: how a marketplace and an industry have grown thanks to inventions like the 15th century printing press.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll learn that this process began with the idea that artistic work is the property of creators and how this idea inspired a new industry based on <strong>copyright</strong>.

If the previous century saw increased cooperation for the exchange of knowledge and all kinds of intellectual goods, war showed the opposite. But at the same time the Industrial Revolution had introduced mechanical reproduction and the war efforts produced new technology like mass communication.

Care Right for All Children: Implementing the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children","introduction":"Ensure that alternative care is a necessary, suitable and positive experience for children, with this free online course.","description":"<p>##</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to determine the number of children in alternative care around the world, but we know that many children continue to be placed unnecessarily in the care system and in unsuitable, sometimes harmful, settings.</p>\n\n<p>To address this, the United Nations General Assembly issued the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children in 2009 based on two fundamental principles – ensuring both the necessity and the suitability of alternative care.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the UN Guidelines as a framework, this free online course will help you gain insight into how the unnecessary placement of a child in alternative care can be prevented; how alternative care can constitute a suitable, positive experience for a child when it is necessary; and how children and young people who are leaving care can best be supported.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-the-necessity-and-suitability-of-alternative-care-with-the-un-guidelines\"><strong>Explore the necessity and suitability of alternative care with the UN Guidelines</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The course will begin with an introduction to alternative care and the UN Guidelines. Then, in Weeks 2 and 3, we will look at the necessity principle – how to support and strengthen families, identify high-risk children and use gatekeeping to prevent unnecessary entry into alternative care.</p>\n\n<p>In Weeks 4 and 5, we will explore the suitability principle, including the need for a range of formal care settings from which to select the one best suited to each child, and what a sustainable deinstitutionalisation policy involves. In the final week we will consider how children can successfully leave care.</p>\n\n<p>To bring your learning to life, each week of the course will include an episode of a specially-made film. This follows the experiences of a family with two children living in vulnerable circumstances as they move through an alternative care system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-with-alternative-care-specialists-from-celcis-unicef-and-the-un\"><strong>Learn with alternative care specialists from CELCIS, UNICEF and the UN</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The course has been developed by CELCIS in the University of Strathclyde  in Scotland in partnership with a steering group established by the Geneva Working Group on Children without Parental Care.

From your discussions with the client, you think it likely that, after they buy the company, several thousand of the company’s employees will be made redundant by your client. Such redundancies will be perfectly legal. Do you, as a lawyer, have an obligation to counsel your clients on the ethics of making those employees redundant? Or is it none of your business? Are you instead simply there to do what the client asks you to do, as long as that request is within the bounds of the law?</p>\n\n<p>In this free, three-week course, we will teach you about the role of lawyers in society and about how they can (and should) balance their obligations to their clients against wider obligations to the public interest. We will cover how different lawyers are regulated, and explore key debates in lawyers’ ethics: how we might decide whether what lawyers do is right or wrong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-the-rights-and-wrongs-corporate-lawyers-face\">Explore the rights and wrongs corporate lawyers face</h2>\n\n<p>During the course, we will look at the different ways in which we can theorise about lawyers’ ethics, and we will then apply those theories to a series of case studies: some general (in Week 2); some focussing on specific research on corporate lawyers working for the world’s largest law firms (in Week 3).</p>\n\n<p>We will talk with experts in legal ethics and the regulation of lawyers about their views on the proper role of lawyers in society. We will also talk with members of the public, and invite you to share your experiences and opinions.

You might be a current or future law student, a practising lawyer, a regulator, or a member of the public.</p>\n\n<p>The course will take an interactive approach, allowing you to both share your own opinions and experiences of lawyers, and learn from experts in legal ethics and legal services regulation.

Ethical research requires thinking carefully about what constitutes participation in research and the responsibilities of researchers not only to participants, but also to all those affected by a study.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-an-ethical-appraisal-framework-to-develop-and-assess-research-proposals\">Use an ethical appraisal framework to develop and assess research proposals</h2>\n<p>On this free online course you will be supported in reflecting on the value of ethical thinking for research and discover an ethical appraisal framework that you can apply to empirical research projects in social science, arts, education and the humanities.

In Week 5 you will be able to apply the insights gained to a draft research proposal through a role play activity. To conclude, in Week 6, we will reflect on how it is important to show integrity as a researcher whilst conducting and reporting studies.

Historically, low levels of antibiotics were added to the feed of healthy livestock, to promote their growth – a practice now banned in the European Union, but still in use elsewhere – while vets still use antibiotics to treat sick animals.</p>\n\n<p>This may have allowed potentially harmful bacteria to become steadily more resistant, including <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, which can make their way from the farm to our dinner plates and lead to infections which may not be treatable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"discover-how-we-can-tackle-antibiotic-resistance\">Discover how we can tackle antibiotic resistance</h3>\n\n<p>During this three-week course, we’ll study what antibiotics are, how they work, and how bacteria become resistant to their effects.

How do antibiotics contaminate the environment? How can antibiotic-resistant bacteria find their way onto our food? What impact does global trade have on the spread of antibiotic resistance?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we consider what might be done to tackle antibiotic resistance. How effective are our current control measures and policies? What are we doing to look for new types of antibiotics? Are there alternatives to antibiotics? What can we do internationally to cooperate on solving this problem?</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you should have all the information you need to make up your own mind about what we should do to tackle this immensely important problem.</p>\n\n<p>This course is for anyone with an interest in antibiotics, food and farming, and how antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will affect our lives in the future.

When financial disturbances have emerged at various times, the whole economy could be affected. Such turbulences have been observed in the slowing of economic growth and, occasionally, even political unrest.</p>\n\n<p>So, if business slumps and financial market turbulence have caused such big problems, why do they tend to re-emerge? Is there nothing to learn from history? During the course, we present five infamous downturns, which had a major impact when they occurred.

You’ll examine different objects closely, learning what each item can tell us about life in ancient times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-ancient-theories-by-examining-the-body\">Understand ancient theories by examining the body</h3>\n<p>On the course we’ll divide the body up into organs and systems, using each as a starting point to explore ancient theories of the structure and function of the human body, and other aspects of ancient life.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll discover ancient Greece and Rome in full, from the public to the personal, and from army and urban life to the lived experience of women and children. Using the evidence on the hair and face, the eyes, the digestive system, the organs of reproduction and the feet you’ll explore topics with which our society still wrestles, including the location of the ‘self’; the relationship between mind and body; identity; food and drink; sanitation; sexuality, ageing and gender.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"improve-your-critical-and-analytical-abilities\">Improve your critical and analytical abilities</h3>\n<p>Through the course you’ll develop some of the skills needed in the study of classics and history including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Improving your ability to critically analyse primary sources</li>\n  <li>Learning to analyse complex problems based on fragmentary evidence</li>\n  <li>Developing your ability to engage with contemporary interpretations and scholarly debates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a taste of what will be covered in this course, read <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/five-things-the-ancient-greeks-can-teach-us-about-medicine-today-43729\">this post</a> from Lead Educator, Helen King.</p>\n\n<p>There are no special requirements for this course, but an interest in the ancient world or classics might be useful.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Health & Psychology","History"],"educator":"Shawndra Hayes-Budgen","organisation":{"url":"http://www.open.ac.uk","name":"The Open University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f9/56/f956cbd9-4d1a-4c94-a0f1-709b860f8e16.png"},"runs":[{"uuid":"4fc201b8-8fde-464a-8c5f-ca0339910891","start_date":"2017-02-06","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"fcdf408d-d30d-4002-91f4-874cf6911474","start_date":"2017-06-05","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"4c4958d7-be84-48a2-9503-290767ee9799","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/nanotechnology-health?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/56/89/regular_568907d7-0264-4ec0-9b8f-22981fd57db9.jpg","name":"Nanotechnology for Health: Innovative Designs for Medical Diagnosis","introduction":"Discover how nanotechnology can be used for many new opportunities in healthcare with top University of Twente researchers.","description":"<h2 id=\"explore-the-use-and-implications-of-nanotechnology-in-new-medical-applications\">Explore the use and implications of nanotechnology in new medical applications</h2>\n\n<p>Nanotechnology is used to control and manipulate nanometer-sized matter with nanometer precision.
